//! Family-2 (category) resolution against ExifTool's own group tables.
//!
//! ExifTool gives every tag a family-2 category — `Image`, `Camera`, `Time`,
//! `Author`, … — taken from the tag's `Groups => { 2 => ... }` override or,
//! failing that, from its table's `GROUPS` default. Our format readers each
//! decided that category on their own, which drifted badly from upstream; this
//! module replaces the guesswork with the generated tables in
//! [`super::group2_generated`], which are extracted from ExifTool itself.
//!
//! The lookup is deliberately conservative. A tag NAME does not determine its
//! category — `BitsPerSample` is `Image` under `File` and `Audio` under RIFF —
//! so the tables are consulted from the most specific key to the least, and an
//! ambiguous key defers to whatever the parser already chose: the parser knows
//! which table the tag came from, and a name lookup does not.
